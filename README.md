Phishing Detection ML
AI-powered phishing detection solution using machine learning to identify and prevent phishing attacks.
Project Overview
This project implements AI and Machine Learning solutions to detect phishing attempts and safeguard organizations from security threats. Drawing from lessons learned in industrial quality control scenarios like the Kobe Steel scandal, this project applies similar preventive measures to cybersecurity.
Key Features
AI-Powered Predictive Analytics

Applies machine learning algorithms to assess threat patterns
Flags suspicious communications based on historical data
Identifies trends indicating potential security threats
Uses deep learning models to detect phishing attempts

Risk Management Using AI

Provides dynamic risk assessments by continuously monitoring factors
Offers real-time insights into emerging threats
Analyzes vast amounts of data to assess threat reliability
Automated risk assessment to identify the most dangerous phishing attempts

Explainable AI (XAI) for Threat Detection

Makes machine learning models transparent and interpretable for security analysts
Provides transparency in how the system identifies threats
Enables real-time threat detection
Improves detection accuracy and enhances security controls
Fosters trust in AI-driven security measures

Digital Twin for Simulation and Optimization

Creates virtual replicas of communication environments
Simulates different attack scenarios
Predicts the impact of various threat vectors
Tests defensive strategies without exposing actual systems

Implementation
This project integrates AI and ML technologies with established security frameworks to create a resilient, proactive security management system that ensures organizational protection even against sophisticated phishing attempts.
